for flat_queue:

/* Mark notes:
 * Why not keep the standard interface... not std::queue's... but...
 * If you can make your move operators noexcept, you should
 * You supply custom copy/move constructors but *not* assignment operators...
 * You definitely should *not* be implementing copy/move stuff
 *    The default does exactly what you're doing manually
 *    Except you've screwed yourself by not having assignment operators
 * The one thing that you could actually get from explicit copy operations is
 *    that you could size the *copy* to fit the data
 * But if you do decide to do that, you should declare the move operators and
 *    set them = default;
 * You should also implement copy/move in terms of swap when convenient
 *    (see copy-swap/create and swap in:
 *    http://www.umich.edu/~eecs381/lecture/ExceptsClassesObjectdynmemory.pdf
 * So, the interface you should be exposing is essentially std::vector's with
 *    adjustments that make sense for a queue
 *    Which also means things like .data, and even operator[], I would say
 */
